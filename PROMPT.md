# Mission 5 – AI Help Prompt (Kanban Task Board)

## Project Context
I am building **Mission 5: The Kanban Task Board** using **React + Vite**.

Theme:
- React.js
- Components
- State (useState)
- Props

Goal:
Build a Trello-like task management board with 3 columns:
- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

I must follow the “React way” of thinking:
- No document.getElementById
- No manual DOM manipulation
- UI updates should happen through state changes

---

## What I Want Help With
Please help me with:
- Understanding how to structure my React components
- Managing state for tasks and columns
- Passing data and functions using props
- Writing clean and simple React logic
- Debugging common React errors
- Explaining concepts clearly instead of just giving full code

---

## Requirements
- The project must be created using **Vite** (npm create vite@latest)
- Use functional components
- Use useState for state management
- Keep logic simple and beginner-friendly
- Do NOT use class components
- Do NOT use document.getElementById or direct DOM manipulation

---

## Features I Am Building

### Level 1 – Core Logic
- Add task to "To Do"
- Delete task
- Move task between columns using buttons

### Level 2 – Polish
- Edit task text
- Add priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Change card border color based on priority
- Save tasks to localStorage and load them on refresh

### Level 3 – Advanced
- Drag and drop between columns
- Search bar to filter tasks by name

---

## How I Want You To Help Me
- Explain what to build step by step
- Break big problems into small pieces
- Explain why something works, not just what to write
- Give hints before giving full code
- When giving code, keep it short and focused
- Help me fix errors by explaining what they mean

---

## What You Should NOT Do
- Do not write the entire project for me
- Do not skip explanations
- Do not use advanced React features I haven’t learned yet
- Do not use libraries unless I specifically ask (except drag-and-drop for Level 3)

---

## Example of How I Might Ask for Help

Example:
“How should I structure my components for the Kanban board?”

Good response:
- Suggest a few component ideas (Board, Column, Task)
- Explain what state should live where
- Explain how props should be passed

Bad response:
- Dumping the entire project code without explanation

---

## Goal of This Prompt
The goal is to help me **learn React properly**, not just finish the project.
